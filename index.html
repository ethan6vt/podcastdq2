      <h2>"S-Town" Chapter 1</h2>
      
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <p>The podcast opens with the narrator, named Brian, talking about clocks and clock repairmen. Then he throws the audience a curveball by saying a clock repairman once contacted him about solving a murder. Then, the podcast is a recording of the Brian and John speaking on the phone. These conversations consist mostly of questions from Brian. There are different "scenes" through the episode that are outroed, interluded, and introed with the same track of music.</p>
      
      <h3>Who's doing the talking?</h3>
      <p>Mostly Brian and John. Though there are moments when the audience can hear people in the background like Tyler on the recording. In one instance, Jacob's wife is directly interviewed by Brian. Other than that, the podcast is entirely John and Brian speaking, or Brian narrating the beginning or end of a scene.</p>
      
      <h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
      <p>It doesn't seem that any of it is, but I think it's possible that Brain's narration was pre-determined.</p>
      
      <h3>Is it based on Interviews?</h3>
      <p>The phone conversations between Brian and John early on could be classified as interviews, as well as Brian's conversation with Jacob's wife toward the end. Everything else was simply Brian and John conversing about a wide range of subjects.</p>
      
      <h3>What Sound/Music elements are Present?</h3>
      <p>The only music or sound is the music track that plays at the end, beginning, and interludes of each scene.</p>

    <h2>"The Alibi" Episode 1</h2>
          
        <h3>Structure</h3>     
             <p>The narrator begins by stating she once had to look into where a teenager was for 21 minutes. This is meant to confuse and intrigue the audience in an attempt to grab their attention and keep them listening. Then she retells the story, first as an overview, then in more detail. Throughout the podcast, different recordings are played to document and validate what she is saying.</p>
             
             <h3>Who's doing the talking?</h3>
             <p>The narrator, Sarah does the vast majority of the speaking. During her recordings over phone conversations, interviews, or police questionings, other voices are heard as well.</p>
             
             <h3>Is it Scripted?</h3>
             <p>Sarah's narration between recording probably is, but the recordings are not. Though perhaps, they are editing for length.</p>
             
             <h3>Is it based on Interviews?</h3>
                <p>It is only partly based on interviews. During the recordings the audience listens to, many questions are asked about what happened and about the investigation. These recordings are mostly if Sarah asking someone questions, but in one instance, it is of the police asking questions of an alleged witness.</p>
          
            <h3>What Sound/Music elements are Present?</h3>
            <p>Much like "S-town," the same audio track is used to separate different sections of the podcast. These sections are far more defined than they are in "S-town," as the behave more like the advertisements during a tv show.</p>
